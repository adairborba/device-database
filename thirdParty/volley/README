Description:

Volley is an HTTP library that makes networking for Android apps easier and most importantly, faster. Volley is available through the open AOSP repository.

Volley offers the following benefits:

* Automatic scheduling of network requests.
* Multiple concurrent network connections.
* Transparent disk and memory response caching with standard HTTP cache coherence.
* Support for request prioritization.
* Cancellation request API. You can cancel a single request, or you can set blocks or scopes of requests to cancel.
* Ease of customization, for example, for retry and backoff.
* Strong ordering that makes it easy to correctly populate your UI with data fetched asynchronously from the network.
* Debugging and tracing tools.

Local Modifications:
* Updated build.gradle to work with environment
